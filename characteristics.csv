"* Not in the original WDQ – splitting out feedback from supervisor/faculty and coworkers/peers maybe important for our research; for workers – we may also need to add feedback from customers, e.g. pharmaceutical or research equipment sales rep may receive formal feedback from buyers and that may affect psychological state (stress levels, satisfaction).",,

For work setting, we may need to add or rename a category (for example sales rep for research reagents/equipment or pharmaceuticals ) that involves working with people. Perhaps URE should parallel this and include working with people?",,
